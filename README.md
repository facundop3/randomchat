## Motivation
  Well as a mostly frontend web developer I'm looking for some excuses to get involved into some backend stuff. I look at [socket.io](https://socket.io/) lib and find it really interesting so I put my hands on it and start building something like a homemade chatroom.
 
 ## Learnt things (or almost learnt things üòÖ)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

  ## To do:
  - Add some [jestjs](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests
